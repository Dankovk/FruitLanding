# Barebones TODO list

## Gulp

 * Automatically add banner to autogenerated files (compass styles, scripts etc)
 * Add a clean task
 * [Consider] rewriting gulp to require a single `gulp install` at installation
   instead of constantly running bower and vendor tasks

## Compass

 * Use support vars in base/_mixin.scss:placeholder()
 * [Consider] moving normalize.scss outside of compass src folder

## Misc

 * Finish README.md
